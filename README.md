Web Development Group Assignment: Portfolio Website
Overview
This is a portfolio webpage we created for Dennis Yator, a UI Designer and Web Developer based in Kenya. The goal was to showcase his skills, services, projects, and provide a downloadable CV. We used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build the webpage.

Approach
First, we carefully analyzed the provided screenshots and broke the page into key sections, such as the header, profile, services ("What I Do For You"), achievements, and successful work.

We started by structuring the HTML, using semantic tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer>. We added navigation links (Home, Work, Services, Blog, Contact) and made sure the profile section included his photo, skills, and a "Download CV" button.

For styling, we leveraged Bootstrap to quickly set up a responsive layout. We also created a custom styles.css file to adjust the colors (mainly blue and white), fonts, and button styles. Ensuring the page was responsive for both desktop and mobile was a priority.

We used images from Pexels for the profile and project showcase and included a downloadable CV (dennis_yator_cv.pdf). Social media links, like LinkedIn, were added with icons from Font Awesome.

Challenges
Initially, we faced some challenges linking the styles and making the mobile version work correctly. However, after adjusting Bootstrap classes and custom CSS, we were able to resolve these issues.
